## Week of March 11, 2024
### What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?
#### I would really like to be better able to organize a website. Making it have a great user experience and good flow would be fantastic. I am going to practice by restructuring this blog!

### What are you struggling with?
#### Right now I'm struggling with finding the balance amongst things, there is just a lot happening all at once with teaching, starting this program, and a general busy season of life. I keep thinking about how nice it will be in 6 months, when I will hopefully have a job and focus on that exclusively.

### How do you solve a problem? 
#### I tend to really hammer at something until I understand what's happening, almost too much. 


-this is how to insert images-
### Please enjoy a few pictures from the two countries I visited last year in 2023, Scotland and Japan (including one picture of Mount Fuji on a clear day!):
